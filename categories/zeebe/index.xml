      <title>Zero-Scale Zeebe with Cloudflare Workers</title>

      <description>I get questions about running Zeebe at &amp;ldquo;zero-scale&amp;rdquo;. That means workers that consume no resources when there are no tasks to perform.
The Zeebe service on Camunda Cloud includes a generic HTTP-Worker that can be used to achieve this. The HTTP-Worker polls for jobs of type &amp;ldquo;Camunda-HTTP&amp;rdquo;, and then invokes a REST endpoint based on the HTTP verb and URL set in the task headers. If you are not on Camunda Cloud you can use zeebe-http-worker, or just write your own.</description>

      <description>Update: I now work at Camunda on Zeebe as the Node client maintainer and a Developer Advocate. Things have changed in the broker and the library since this was published - for the latest on using it, refer to my new book in development - &amp;ldquo;The Zeebe Node.js Client Guide&amp;quot;
Iâ€™m proud to announce that Credit Sense has open-sourced our Node.js client library for Zeebe. Check it out on GitHub and start using it now!</description>

      <description>Over the last 20 years, I&#39;ve done a fair amount of travel around the world. My first trip out of New Zealand on my own - in 1996, to Sydney - was a hot mess. I had no idea that you have to pass through a metal detector at the airport, and I rocked up with batteries, coins, a metal chain on my wallet, a Maglite torch, and a multi-headed screwdriver in my pockets.</description>
