      <description>Zeebe is a workflow engine for orchestrating microservices, using BPMN models to define complex workflows that can be monitored operationally using a graphical representation of the process state.
Thanks to a feature request from Jimmy Beaudoin, the 0.23.0-alpha.1 release of the Zeebe Node client introduces a new worker - the ZBBatchWorker.
Motivation Sometimes you have external resources that your microservices access - maybe a database or a rate-limited or pay-per-call API.</description>

      <description>When I wrote the first iteration of the Zeebe Node client library in the first months of 2019, I didn&#39;t have any experience in using it. How could I - it didn&#39;t exist.
One early design decision has haunted me for the last year, causing me sleepless nights as I toss and turn, tormented by my guilty conscience.
The ZBClient.createWorker() method - to create a new job worker process - takes as one of its parameters an id, used to uniquely identify a specific instance of a worker in events exported from the broker.</description>
