      <description>Scene One: Camp JS viii Last weekend I was at Camp JS viii in Melbourne. Camp JS is a community-run event that brings together JavaScript hackers from around Australia for a weekend of fun, frolicking, and JavaScripting. This yearâ€™s one was the biggest ever, with 160 attendees and 32 talks. Amazing weekend.
 Cool iron-on patch and awesome Zine organised by Anna Gerber  I got to hang out more with my peeps from BrisJS -the Brisbane JavaScript Meetup- and meet other inspiring and creative developers from around Australia and New Zealand.</description>
