      <description>I’m at the Investor Pitch night at The Triffid, in Brisbane’s Fortitude Valley. Apparently over 500 people have turned out for the event (someone says it is closer to 1000), and it is packed. Not even standing room. People are spilling out of the event space into the bar. Inside, Venture Capitalists are pitching a panel of startup founders — a reversal of the usual roles.

So what the f*&amp;amp;# went wrong?</description>
