      <description>Over 12 months ago, I switched to the Halmak keyboard layout.
I blogged about it at the end of 2019. Since then, I periodically get emails and DMs on Twitter asking me if I kept going with it.
The answer is &amp;ldquo;Yes&amp;rdquo;.
I use Halmak every day on my Koolertron AE-SMKD62, and when I need to type silently at night on my Anne Pro 2.
Some observations It turns out that a texting (thumb) keyboard and touch-typing are stored in different parts of the brain.</description>

      <description>In July of 2018, after 35 years of typing on QWERTY layout - 24 of those years touch-typing as a professional software developer and author, I switched to the Dvorak keyboard layout.
I couldn&amp;rsquo;t tell you why I did it. I just did. At the time I was training for a physique competition (that will be another blog post). But I don&amp;rsquo;t know if that had anything to do with it (maybe it was a low-carb moment&amp;hellip;).</description>
