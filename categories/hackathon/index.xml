      <description>In October 2017, I had the absolute privilege of organising the CloudTrek Big Data, Big Heart Hackathon.
Cloud Trekâ€™s MD, Neil Hitz, came to me with the idea for a Hackathon event that would have a humanitarian / social impact.
I used the training I got in the Landmark Self-Expression and Leadership Program to structure the event. In that program you do a project where you mobilise one community (the target community) to cause an impact in another community (the beneficiary community).</description>

      <description>On 26 March, we took out second place in the 2017 Flight Centre Data Hackathon. Our team was a mix of engineers, designers, and business analysts from Magikcraft.io, Code Network, Just Digital People, and Just Media Design. A few of us have worked together on projects before, a few of us know each other but have never worked together on a project, and some of us met for the first time at Fishburners on the Friday night of the Hackathon.</description>
