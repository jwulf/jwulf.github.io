      <description>There is no such thing as good coding, only good refactoring.
 I recently did a bunch of work on the Zeebe Node.js client for the upcoming 0.23 release. Zeebe Node is a client library for the Zeebe Microservices Workflow Orchestration Engine, and I maintain it.
While doing other work, I took the opportunity to refactor one method, deployWorkflows, to add a feature that I wanted it to have. I used fp-ts, a TypeScript Functional Programming library to do it.</description>
