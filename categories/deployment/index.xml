      <description>I frequently deploy Web APIs in Docker. On a single VM I might have up to five or six services running. All of them have TLS certificates and are accessible via port 443 using SNI â€” Server Name Indication, where the request is routed to the correct backend based on the domain name of the request.
This is very easy to set up using letsencrypt-nginx-sidecar, (which builds on this project and this project).</description>
